# Text Maturity App

This app is the continuation of my [portfolio project](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity) which predicts the mininum age a reader should be for a given book based on its features (title, genre, and book type).

The deployed web app is live at https://text-maturity.herokuapp.com/

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

- numpy  
- pandas  
- pickle  
- streamlit  
- tensorflow-cpu
